This repository contains solutions for a variety of Leetcode problems. I have also included test cases for the problems 

I run test cases on merge requests through Github workflows, run a jacoco test coverage, 
along with creating a codecov coverage report.

Moreover, I am trying to ensure a good quality repo with the help of static code analysis tools such as pmd and spotbugs, and monitoring the code quality through Codacy.
